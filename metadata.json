    "Title": "3D pharmacophore descriptor",
    "Description": "The pharmacophore mapper (pmapper) identifies common 3D pharmacophores of active compounds against a specific target and uniquely encodes them with hashes suitable for fast identification of identical pharmacophores. The obtained signatures are amenable for downstream ML tasks.\n",
