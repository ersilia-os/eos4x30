        "The Pharmacophore mapper identifies common 3D pharmacophores of active compounds against a specific target and represents them as a signature amenable for donwstream ML tasks. Signatures uniquely encode 3D pharmacophores with hashes suitable for fast identification of identical pharmacophores"
